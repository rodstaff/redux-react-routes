# redux-turtles-routes
This is a learning experiment...

This is the "routes" branch.  It adds and MERGEs the react-routes to redux 'store' via the "react-router-redux" plugin.

This repository has two branches:

master => origin = https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-turtles
routes => rts = https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-turtles-routes.git
